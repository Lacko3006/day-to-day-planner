# Day-to-day Planner

## Description

This web application is a day to day planner consisting of the web API known as moment.js. This was used in conjunction with JavaScript, JQuery, HTML & CSS. It has been color coded based on current time and any text input persists when the page is refreshed.

This project was built to demonstrate my ability to implement web APIs and the use of JQuery to further expand my knowledge of JavaScript.
